 ***Kenneth*** *: Good morning! My name is Kenneth Browder, and I
am a junior Computer Science major at Grove City College. I’m here with ChatGPT
today for a brief interview to give us all an insider look into what the buzz
is all about. ChatGPT, which was released near the end of 2022, is a digital
assistant who has gained quite a bit of notoriety lately, becoming one of the
most used tools on the internet. Especially impressive is the incredibly fast
adoption rate of this new service – it seems like everybody wants a piece of
you! So, ChatGPT, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself.*

 ***ChatGPT*** *: Good morning Kenneth! It's great to meet you. As
you mentioned, I'm ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. I was
released near the end of 2022 and since then, I have gained a lot of attention
and popularity due to my ability to understand and respond to natural language
queries. As an AI language model, I have been trained on a massive amount of
data from the internet, books, and other sources. This allows me to understand
and generate responses to a wide range of topics, from simple questions to
complex discussions. My main goal is to assist and provide useful information
to my users. I can help with a variety of tasks, such as answering questions,
providing recommendations, translating languages, and even generating creative
content such as stories, poems, and songs. I'm designed to be constantly
learning and improving, so as more people use me, I become even more
knowledgeable and efficient. I'm excited to continue to grow and help people in
their daily lives.*

***KB:**** Good for you. I'd like to know some more about
your history. As I understand it, you were developed by a collaboration between
some big names in tech. Who are these people?*

***ChatGPT:**** Certainly! OpenAI is the organization behind my
development, with a focus on advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and
beneficial manner. Founded in 2015, OpenAI was established by a group of
prominent tech figures, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya
Sutskever, John Schulman, and others. While Musk resigned from the board in
2018 due to potential conflicts of interest, CEO Sam Altman now leads a team of
over 100 researchers and engineers who work on various AI projects, including
my development. I was trained using unsupervised learning on a massive dataset
of internet text, utilizing a Transformer architecture designed to process
language sequences. Through this training, I have become adept at learning the
patterns and nuances of human language, making me a valuable tool for assisting
people in their daily lives.*

***KB:**** Tell me a little more about OpenAI. What was it
originally created to do, what are some other projects by OpenAI that have
gained traction, and how has it changed over the last eight years?*

***ChatGPT: ****OpenAI was founded in 2015 with a mission to
develop AI in a safe and beneficial way for humanity. Its founders, including
Elon Musk, wanted to ensure AI was developed ethically and responsibly.
Initially, OpenAI focused on researching key areas like machine learning,
natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. One of its early
achievements was GPT-2, my predecessor, which could write realistic text and
even full news articles and stories. OpenAI has continued to work on several
exciting projects since then, including DALL-E, which can create unique and
realistic images from textual descriptions, and Codex, an AI-powered
programming tool that can generate code from natural language descriptions.
Over the past eight years, OpenAI has grown significantly, both in size and in
its efforts. It has expanded its team of researchers and engineers, established
partnerships with Microsoft and SpaceX, and has become more involved in
advocacy and policy discussions around AI ethics and safety. The organization's
focus on responsible AI development and research has helped shape the
conversation around AI's impact on society.*

***KB:**** Great! Now let’s get back to you, ChatGPT. You
refer to yourself as an AI Language Model, I’ve also heard other researchers
refer to you as a large language model. Briefly, what does this mean?*

***ChatGPT:**** No problem! When people talk about "AI
language models" or "large language models" like me, they're
talking about a type of algorithm that's specifically designed to understand
and generate natural language. Basically, these algorithms are trained on huge
amounts of text from the internet so they can develop a deep understanding of
language and generate coherent responses to a wide range of questions. The
"large" in "large language model" refers to the fact that
these models have a lot of variables that help them understand language, which
makes them more complex and powerful. In my case, I was trained using a
specific type of neural network called a Transformer architecture, which is
really good at understanding sequences of data like sentences. Because of this
training, I'm able to understand the patterns and nuances of human language and
help people with all sorts of questions and tasks!*

***KB:**** I see. We’re running low on time, so I’d
appreciate it if you could keep your responses succinct, even if this means you
can’t get to your catchphrases. Explain what a neural network does, and what is
different about a transformer architecture.*

***ChatGPT:**** Certainly! A neural network is a type of machine
learning algorithm modeled after the human brain, consisting of layers of
interconnected nodes that process and transform data to learn patterns and make
predictions. A Transformer architecture is a type of neural network designed
for sequential data like natural language sentences, processing all words
simultaneously to capture longer-range dependencies and relationships between
words effectively. This is achieved through self-attention, which allows the
network to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence.
Transformers are especially useful for language translation and text
generation, where understanding relationships between parts of a sentence or
document is crucial.*

***KB:**** Interesting. So, the alignment problem is more
about ensuring that AI system actually does what it’s intended to do in the
long run. What does research into this problem look like?intended to do in the
long run. What does research into this problem look like?*

***ChatGPT:**** Yup, that's correct. The alignment problem aims
to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a way that aligns with
human values and objectives, and operates as intended in the long term. Experts
from diverse fields such as computer science, philosophy, economics, and
sociology are working together on this multi-disciplinary issue. Approaches
being taken include technical methods that develop AI algorithms and
architectures that align with human values and goals, ethical and policy
frameworks to guide AI development, and societal approaches that engage with
stakeholders to ensure AI is socially responsible and beneficial. The challenge
is complex, but it's critical to ensure that AI benefits humanity and aligns
with our values and objectives.*

***KB:**** Alright. What would you say is the best way to
use AI systems in a way that aligns with human values and objectives? What are
these values and objectives?*

***ChatGPT:**** In order to use AI systems in a way that aligns
with human values and objectives, there are several key principles to follow,
including transparency, accountability, privacy, fairness, and safety. However,
there is no one answer that fits all situations, and the values and objectives
that AI systems should align with will vary based on the context and needs of the
individuals and communities involved. Ultimately, AI systems should promote
human flourishing, protect individual rights and freedoms, and ensure equitable
access to opportunities and resources.*

***KB:**** What sorts of tasks are you not able to perform?*

***ChatGPT: ****As an AI language model, I cannot perform physical
tasks, interpret visual information like humans, experience emotions, or create
original content. I am best suited for tasks that involve processing or
generating natural language, such as answering questions, summarizing text, or
generating text based on prompts. Other types of tasks require different types
of AI systems or human intelligence.*

***KB:**** One of the great things about OpenAI’s initial
vision, and earlier iterations of the GPT model, was their open nature. Most of
the concepts required to replicate the abilities of the model were published
and free to be iterated upon by other researchers. One of the reasons this was
a good thing is that tasks that the model struggled with could be known and improved
on by others in the scientific community without having to start over from
scratch. What are some of the other dangers of models like GPT3.5 and GPT4
being closed, proprietary models?*

***ChatGPT: ****One of the main dangers of closed, proprietary
models like GPT3.5 and GPT-4 is that they limit access to the underlying
technology and data used to train the model. This can create significant
barriers to entry for other researchers, startups, or organizations that want
to build on or improve the technology. It can also limit transparency and
accountability, as outside researchers may not have access to the data and
algorithms used to develop the model, making it difficult to evaluate its
effectiveness or potential biases.*

***ChatGPT: ****Another concern is that closed models may be used
to reinforce existing power imbalances or biases in society. If the development
of AI models is controlled by a small group of companies or organizations,
there is a risk that these models will reflect the interests and biases of
those organizations, rather than the broader public interest. This could lead
to AI systems that discriminate against certain groups, or reinforce existing
social, economic, or political inequalities.*

***ChatGPT: ****Overall, there are significant benefits to open
research and collaboration in the development of AI models, including greater
transparency, accountability, and the potential for innovation and progress.
While there may be some advantages to closed, proprietary models, it's
important to weigh these against the potential risks and benefits of open
research and development.*

***KB: ****Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any
concluding remarks on what we've talked about today?*

***ChatGPT:**** Thank you for the interesting conversation! As an
AI language model, I think it's important to continue exploring the
capabilities and limitations of AI systems, as well as the ethical and safety
considerations that come with their development and deployment. While AI has
the potential to bring about many positive changes in the world, it's important
to approach its use with caution and mindfulness, and to prioritize the values
and objectives that we want our AI systems to align with. I look forward to
seeing how AI continues to develop and evolve in the years to come, and to
being a part of these conversations as they unfold.*

***KB:**** One last question. I notice you have some
repeated phrases in our interview, such as "learn the patterns and nuances
of human language and become a powerful tool for assisting people in their
daily lives." Is this part of your prompt?*

***ChatGPT:**** Yes, as an AI language model, I am programmed to
generate responses based on the input I receive, which includes some
pre-programmed responses that I can use in appropriate situations. These are
often referred to as "prompts" or "templates" and can help
me generate responses more quickly and accurately. However, I am also designed
to generate unique responses based on the specific input I receive, and I
strive to provide relevant and helpful information to the best of my abilities.*
