# Good morning, I'm Kenneth Browder.
This is, in fact, the website of Kenneth Browder(@pandanautinspace). I am a sophomore computer science student at Grove City College, but I've been playing with computers for a while.

## Projects
I've worked on a few projects over the years. We have:


folio / myJournal: My COMP220 Project, done with @Jaxaar and @ReviewEdge. It's a social journaling application, allowing you to follow and contribute to writing about topics close to your heart. MVP has been created.

LittleYellowFileManager (LYFM): A submarined themed file management application, with a killer deep dive feature, so you can explore deeper into your file tree without ever losing track of where you were. Still in progress.

Beef / BeefVM: A programming language running on a virtual machine with only Brainf*** instructions. Still in progress.

AVP-HS: A group of high-school students at Portland State University working together to make an autonomous vehicle that can compete with college groups.

QABoard: A Â­web application facilitating easier interactive learning testing for teachers. Made using Python Flask and Async JS. Web app is fully functional.
